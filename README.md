# Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive visualization of historical U.S.
Housing Price Index values. More specifically, we identified a few detailed objectives:
1. Compare the HPI of different states at a historical time point
2. Visualize changes of HPI of a state over time
3. Provide more detailed HPI of different counties within a state
From our visualization, users will gain deep understanding of housing price changes in
the United States in general, and more specifically, changes within different states and
counties.

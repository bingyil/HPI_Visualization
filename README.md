# Housing Price Index Visualization

Team Members: Bingyi Li, Guoqiang Liang

## Goal
Create an interactive visualization of historical U.S. Housing Price Index values

## Brief Intro
The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive visualization of historical U.S. Housing Price Index values. More specifically, we identified a few detailed objectives:
1. Compare the HPI of different states at a historical time point
2. Visualize changes of HPI of a state over time
3. Provide more detailed HPI of different counties within a state
From our visualization, users will gain deep understanding of housing price changes in
the United States in general, and more specifically, changes within different states and
counties.

## Deliverable
The [presentation slides](https://github.com/bingyil/HPI_Visualization/blob/master/A%20STORY%20OF%20HOUSING%20PRICE%20INDEX.pdf) is a high-level demonstration of the discussion.<br/>
The visualization itself is held on our [Github Webpage](https://asenliang.github.io)
